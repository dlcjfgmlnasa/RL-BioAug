# RL-BioAug

## Abstract
Contrastive learning has emerged as a promising paradigm in EEG analysis by reducing reliance on labeled data. In general, the effectiveness of contrastive learning fundamentally depends on the quality of data augmentation due to non-stationarity of EEG signals with statistical properties changing over time. Static or random augmentation strategies can corrupt intrinsic information, therefore leading to degraded performance in representation learning. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based autonomous augmentation framework for self-supervised EEG representation learning. The proposed RL agent analyzes the features of input signals to determine an optimal augmentation policy tailored to each instance. Experimental results demonstrated that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets. Notably, this agent adaptively chose optimal strategies---for example, 'Time Masking' for sleep stage classification and 'Crop Resize' for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.
